### Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run this template on your local machine:

1. Begin by downloading and extracting the template from **Next.js Templates**.

2. Once you've done that, navigate into the template directory using the **cd** command.

3. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following commands:

```bash
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
**Note:** As of right now React 19 causes peer dependencies issues with some packages, so the `legacy-peer-deps` flag is required.

4. Now you're ready to start the project on your local server. Use the following command to get it up and running:

```bash
    npm run dev
 ```

This will launch the template on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Our comprehensive documentation includes all the guides you'll need for integrating various features.
